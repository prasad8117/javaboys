1. What is Java?

Java is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems in 1991. It was officially released in 1995.
It’s famous for its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" capability, meaning Java programs can run on any device that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) without needing modification.
2. Key Features of Java

    Simple – Easy to learn if you know basic programming concepts like variables, loops, and functions.

    Object-Oriented – Everything in Java is treated as an object (except primitive data types).

    Platform-Independent – Compiled Java code runs anywhere thanks to the JVM.

    Secure – Has built-in security features like bytecode verification and sandboxing.

    Robust – Strong memory management and exception handling.

    Multithreaded – Can run multiple tasks at the same time.

    Distributed – Supports network programming and distributed systems.

    High Performance – Thanks to Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation in the JVM.

3. How Java Works

Java follows a two-step compilation process:

    Source Code (.java) → compiled by javac into Bytecode (.class)

    Bytecode → executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) on any platform

This is why Java is platform-independent—the same bytecode can run on Windows, Mac, Linux, or any device with a JVM.
4. Java Editions

Java comes in different editions for different purposes:

    Java SE (Standard Edition) → Core Java for desktop and general-purpose applications

    Java EE (Enterprise Edition) → For large-scale web and enterprise apps

    Java ME (Micro Edition) → For mobile and embedded devices

    JavaFX → For rich internet applications and GUI development

5. Common Uses of Java

    Desktop Applications (e.g., Eclipse IDE, NetBeans)

    Web Applications (e.g., using Spring, JSP, Servlets)

    Mobile Apps (especially Android)

    Game Development

    Cloud Applications

    Big Data Processing (Hadoop uses Java)

6. First Java Program Example

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
    }
}

Explanation:

    public class HelloWorld → Defines a class named HelloWorld.

    public static void main(String[] args) → Entry point of the program.

    System.out.println(...) → Prints text to the console.
